# Windows Desktop Build

I've always wanted to build my own Windows desktop, and being stuck at home during the pandemic gave me the perfect opportunity to finally do it.

* After a bunch of research, I settled on a price range and configuration, and gathered all the parts I needed from Newegg, Micro Center, and Amazon.

* Once I had everything, I spent a whole day reading tutorials and watching [tech YouTubers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5jFXl0GZJo) to figure out how to build my machine.

* When I finally finished the build, it was such a cool moment to see the lights come on for the first time. I'll never forget that feeling of joy.

* I also found this awesome software called [Symless Synergy](https://symless.com/synergy) that lets me use my desktop's keyboard and mouse to control both my Windows desktop and my Macbook. It also supports clipboard sharing, which is super convenient.

* Now I can easily code in both Windows and MacOS environments.
