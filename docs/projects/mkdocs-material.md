## What is Mkdocs Material?

I created this website using [Mkdocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), a Python package that allows you to create brilliant and professional-looking static sites using markdown language.  It's highly customizable, designed to work on all devices, lightweight, and open source.


## Free Hosting with GitHub Pages
One great benefit GitHub offers is free web hosting using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  With the use of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), you can upload your source code, deploy it, and host it all in one place.  You can configure your repo so that every merge to a specified branch will trigger your deployment pipeline and automatically publish your website in under a minute.
