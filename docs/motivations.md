# Motivations

We live in extraordinary times thanks to technology.  The world's knowledge is at our fingertips.  And because of this, I developed a passion for learning new crafts and skills.

## Home Network

When we first moved into our house, we noticed the WiFi signal was weak on the side of the house opposite where the modem and router were installed. After researching my options, I converted an old Asus RT-N66U router into a Wireless Access Point to extend my house's WiFi signal.

* I installed new networking wallplates and CAT5e connectors throughout my house.
* I crimped my own CAT5e cables and ran them through the walls and attic from the main router to where the WAP would live.
* I flashed the firmware on my old RT-N66U router and installed DD-WRT software.  I configured it to be in Wireless Access Point (WAP) mode.
* I used the same SSID and security settings of my upstream router to allow free roaming access throughout the house.  Wireless devices automatically detect the stronger signal strength and connect to the WAP seamlessly.

## Home Office

My home office has a Windows 10 Desktop and my Macbook Pro running Ventura.

* I built the Windows machine peice-by-peice, sourcing parts from Newegg, Micro Center, and Amazon.  The following weekend after the last part arrived, I spent the day reading online tutorials and watching popular tech YouTube videos to build my machine.  After I finished the build, seeing the lights come on for the first time sparked a moment of joy, I would never forget.
* Using Symless Synergy software, I can share my desktop's keyboard and mouse and control my Windows desktop and Macbook.  The software even supports clipboard sharing.
* This setup allows me to easily experiment with coding in both Windows and MacOS environments.
