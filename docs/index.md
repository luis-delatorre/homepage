Tests were automatically triggered on GitHub repository pushes, completing within an hour and enabling seamless merging on passing results.
    * Implemented automated tests for web features using Python, PyTest, Selenium WebDriver, and MySQL connectors. This optimized testing efficiency by reducing the manual check time from 2 hours to 20 minutes.
    * Scheduled nightly regression tests through Jenkins to ensure the stability of the testing suite against production code.
    * Utilized Graphite, Grafana, and Kibana as observability tools to monitor server performance and troubleshoot application and server errors.
    * Conducted code reviews for development and test automation pull requests across numerous GitHub repositories, emphasizing proper test case coverage and advocating for shift-left and testing pyramid principles. This fostered increased test case creation by developers and application design with testing in mind.
    * Conducted Epic reviews with development teams and stakeholders to provide project progress reports and discuss risks for mitigation or acceptance.
    * Collaborated with the product team to set up environments and test data for conducting User Acceptance Testing (UAT) on client-facing application changes.
    * Mentored team members through regular one-on-one meetings, addressing roadblocks, documenting achievements, reviewing assignment progress, and providing guidance toward their bi-annual SMART goals. This facilitated data-driven mid-year and end-year performance reviews.
    * Utilized TestRail, JIRA, and JellyFish tools to monitor team productivity and report on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to stakeholders.
    * Led various sprint ceremonies, including scrum, sprint planning, backlog grooming, and sprint retrospectives.
    * Participated as a panelist in a monthly "QA Community of Practice" involving experts from different teams, aiming to share knowledge, exchange best practices, and define standards. Effectively disseminated technical and workflow improvements across the department.
