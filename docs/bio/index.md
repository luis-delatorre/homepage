# About Me

I'm a Brooklyn native currently residing in New York.  I am passionate about connecting with people and enjoy engaging in friendly conversations and making new acquaintances.  Traveling and immersing myself in different cultures is an absolute pleasure for me.  It has made me more open-minded, appreciative of what we have, and a proponent of embracing cultural influences from other regions.

I am a helpful individual who finds joy in working on collaborative projects.  I wilfully impart and share information with others to help them become successful.  Or volunteer my time and energy to help someone out.  It's fulfilling to contribute to a project or team's success and see the impact of my efforts.
